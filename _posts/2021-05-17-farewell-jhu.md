I am eternally grateful to the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University for creating an environment wherein my academic curiosity and research interests could flourish. I will never forget the privilege of leading an Undergraduate BME Design Team or my amazement when, during a dissection in Computational Cardiology Lab, a decapitated bullfrog autonomically flipped over off its back and started breathing. Over these past four years, I have lost track of how many times I have felt inspired by the knowledge surrounding me.

My academic career at JHU would not have been possible without: the transformational mentorship of Dr. Joshua T. Vogelstein; the teachings of Dr. Carey E. Priebe and Dr. Avanti Athreya; the support from Ben Pedigo, Jaewon Chung, Ronak Mehta, Ronan Perry, Alex Loftus, Eric Bridgeford, Mike Powell, Jayanta Dey, and Sambit Panda; and the entire NeuroData Lab.

I will forever cherish the friendships I have made with my peers and professors at JHU. Thank you Natasha, John, Stephen, Lucas, Mitchell, Will, Maggie, Chester, Bolaji, Angela, Christine, Dr. Lu, Dr. Miller, Dr. Fishkind, Dr. Hasan, and Dr. Logsdon for supporting me as I pursue my dreams.

And finally, to my parents, I owe the deepest debt of gratitude. My accomplishments would not be possible without the foundation of love and support you have provided me my entire life. Thank you for always believing in me, even when I did not believe in myself.
