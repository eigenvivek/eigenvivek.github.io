<p>I am a PhD student in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics at the <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/">Harvard-MIT
        Program in Health Sciences and Technology</a>, advised by <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/">Polina
        Golland</a>. My work is supported by the <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/academic-programs/memp/neuroimaging-training-program">
        NIH Neuroimaging Training Program</a>. My current research interests lie in the development of machine learning 
        methods for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular and neurovascular disease.</p>

<p>My past research has focused on the development of computational methods to analyze multi-subject neuroimaging data.
    Previously, I developed statistical graph theory algorithms to perform biomarker discovery
    in network-valued maps of the brain (advised by Dr. Joshua Vogelstein and Dr. Carey Priebe). I also led a
    Design Team of undergraduate biomedical engineers to build a dynamic fusion image guidance system for minimally
    invasive heart surgery (advised by Dr. Elizabeth Logsdon and Dr. Rani Hasan).</p>
