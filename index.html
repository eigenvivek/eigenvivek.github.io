<p>I am a PhD student in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics at the <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/">Harvard-MIT
        Program in Health Sciences and Technology</a>. My current research interests lie in the development of machine
    learning methods for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.
</p>

<p>My past research has focused on the development of computational methods to analyze multi-subject neuroimaging and
    cardiovascular data. Most recently, I developed statistical graph theory algorithms to perform biomarker discovery
    in network-valued maps of the brain (advised by Dr. Joshua T. Vogelstein and Dr. Carey E. Priebe). I also led a
    Design Team of undergraduate biomedical engineers to build a dynamic fusion image guidance system for minimally
    invasive heart surgery (advised by Dr. Elizabeth Logsdon and Dr. Rani Hasan).</p>
