# A Fun Interpretation of Unitary Matrices
2022-05-28 â˜¾ *Why are the rows orthonormal?*

This is a proof that if the columns of the matrix are orthonormal, then the rows are also orthonormal.

Let $U \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ be a square matrix such that its columns form an orthonormal basis over $\mathbb{C}^n$.
That is, for each pair of columns $x_i$ and $x_j$, the inner product $x_i^* x_j = \delta_{ij}$.[^1]
If we think about matrix multiplication as a series of inner products between the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second matrix, then this gives us the following identities:

$$(U^*U)_{ij} = x_i^* x_j = \delta_{ij} \Longrightarrow U^*U = I \Longrightarrow UU^* = I \,,$$

where the last identity follows from the fact that if $AB=I$, then $BA=I$.[^2]
But this is interesting... the last identity implies that the *rows* of $U$ are also orthonormal!
**If the columns of the matrix are orthonormal, then why are the rows also orthonormal?**

[^1]: This is the Kronecker delta. It equals $1$ if $x_i = x_j$ and $0$ otherwise.
[^2]: See the proof [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3852/if-ab-i-then-ba-i). Note that the class of square matrices $U$ adhering to the identity $ U^*U = UU^* = I \,, $ are the [unitary matrices](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unitary_matrix).

To answer this, it helps think about matrix multiplication as a series of *outer* products: $ U^*U = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i^* \,. $
For a pair of orthonormal vectors $x_i$ and $x_j$, the rank-one matrix $ P_{x_i} = x_i x_i^* $ represents the orthogonal projection onto the vector $x_i$.
Therefore,

$$ UU^* = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i^* = P_{x_1} + \cdots + P_{x_n} = I \,. $$

Here's why the last equality holds: since the vectors $\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ form a basis over $\mathbb{C}^n$, the sum of $n$ rank-one projection matrices forms a projection into $\mathbb C^n \,.$ Therefore, multiplying a vector $y \in \mathbb C^n$ by the matrix $UU^*= (P_{x_1} + \cdots + P_{x_n})$ results in no loss of dimensionality since we are projecting onto the full vector space $\mathbb C^n$.
That is,

\begin{align}
    UU^* y
    &= (P_{x_1} + \cdots + P_{x_n}) y \\
    &= P_{x_1} y + \cdots + P_{x_n} y \\
    &= c_1 x_1 + \cdots + c_n x_n \\
    &= y \,, &&\text{(It's just a change of basis!)}
\end{align}

implying that $$UU^* = I \,.$$

This proof shows that orthonormal columns imply orthonormal rows, giving another intuition for the geometric behavior of unitary matrices.
