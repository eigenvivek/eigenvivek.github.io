I am a PhD student in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics at the [Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/), advised by [Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/).
My work is supported by the [NIH Neuroimaging Training Program](https://hst.mit.edu/academic-programs/memp/neuroimaging-training-program).
My current research interests lie in the development of machine learning and computer vision methods for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular and neurovascular disease.

My past research has focused on the development of computational methods to analyze multi-subject neuroimaging data.
Previously, I developed statistical graph theory algorithms to perform biomarker discovery in network-valued maps of the brain (advised by Dr. Joshua Vogelstein and Dr. Carey Priebe). 
I also led a Design Team of undergraduate biomedical engineers to build a dynamic fusion image guidance system for minimally
invasive heart surgery (advised by Dr. Elizabeth Logsdon and Dr. Rani Hasan).
