I am a second-year PhD student at MIT CSAIL advised by [https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/ Dr. Polina Golland]. Motivated by unment clinical needs, my research develops biomedical machine learning methods that deepen our ability to understand and treat diseases.

My interests lie in the following areas in medicine and machine learning:
- *Neural fields* → spatiotemporal vessel reconstruction in neurosurgery
- *Differentiable rendering* → fast registration for intraoperative image guidance
- *Statistical graph theory* → biomarker discovery in network neuroscience
- *Matrix analysis* → no biomedical applications yet, but I do love a good eigenvalue property!

Before starting my PhD, I completed my BS/MS in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, where I worked with [https://neurodata.io/about/jovo/ Dr. Joshua Vogelstein] and [https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/ Dr. Carey Priebe] in the [https://neurodata.io/ NeuroData Lab].
My work is supported by a [https://hst.mit.edu/academic-programs/memp/neuroimaging-training-program Neuroimaging Training Program Grant] from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.
